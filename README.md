# Hello, World! -- My name is Tony! 

* I'm a Linux/Open Source Fan and Advocate!
* I enjoy learning new technologies, problem solving and working with the cloud, both public and private.
* I get excited about logistics, process improvement, creating tools to improve day-to-day operations for humans and machines, as well creating documentation.
* I am striving to grow as a well rounded Engineer, dividing my time between Systems Engineering and Architecture, Software Development, and Operations work.
* I'm happiest when working on providing a stable platform for customers to deploy their applications. 
* I'm even happier when automating and creating tools to improve process efficiency and availability.
* When I'm not at work, I like spending time with my wife and cat, listening to music, watching movies, and expanding my skills by learning new technologies and platforms. 
* Currently I am focusing on improving my coding skills through Python and Go as well as various other technologies that are revolutionizing the industry.

If you'd like to know more about me, please feel free to reach out to me!
Thank you!
